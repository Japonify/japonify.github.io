    <h2>Thanks for downloading our app to learn Japanese</h2>
    <p>
      Learn Japanese by practicing it !
    </p>

    <p>
      This app mainly for beginners in Japanese is also for people who want to practice (read Japanese) and learn new vocabulary.
      It has been developed by a Fan to help when learning Japanese with to me the most important point: The practice !
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistakes that you will encounter in this application are on purpose.
      To learn a language, you have to work, look for mistakes and correct them!
    </p>

    <p>
      Believe me if you do all this, you will learn the rules and principles on how to do sentences in Japanese (which is the hardest to learn) ...
    </p>

    <p>
      After this, you will only need to learn new vocabulary to be bilingual :)
